"How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?"
Diff gives the list of the lines thar are different between two files. Examinig the list
and those different lines can help us find the bug.

"How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?"
It can help to watch the progress, backup progress, save all the attempts and techniques that were not used.

"What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?"
Pros are flexibility, cons are the human factor, you can just forget to commit, or you split coffie onto your keyboard.

"Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?"
Because those are not programming related tools.

"How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?"
Git log to visualise the progression and commits, diff to see what have changed.

"How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?"
You become more confident because you always can return to a previous version and because Git facilites the search for the error.

"Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?"
Add my own code.
